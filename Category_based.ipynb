She lives a block away and her name is Susan.\" After dinner, William\\'s dad took him aside. \"Son, I have to talk with you. Your mother and I have been married 30 years. She\\'s a wonderful wife but she has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your half-sister, and I\\'m afraid you can\\'t marry her.\" William was heart-broken. After eight months he eventually started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, \"Dianne said yes! We\\'re getting married in June.\" Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad news. \"Dianne is your half-sister too, William. I\\'m awfully sorry about this.\" William was furious! He finally decided to go to his mother with the news. \"Dad has done so much harm.. I guess I\\'m never going to get married,\" he complained. \"Every time I fall in love, Dad tells me the girl is my half-sister.\" His mother just shook her head. \"Don\\'t pay any attention to what he says, dear. He\\'s not really your father.\"'"

Several years later the company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past. The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge machine. At the end of the day, he marked a small \"x\" in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated: \"This is where your problem is.\" The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service. They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The engineer responded briefly: One chalk mark: $1. Knowing where to put it: $49,999. He was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace. 0\n",
